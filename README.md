# pongo

Pongo provides a simple way of testing Kong plugins

## Requirements

Set up the following when testing against Kong Enterprise:

* Have the Kong Enterprise license key, and set it in `KONG_LICENSE_DATA`.
* Set the Bintray credentials (for pulling Kong Enterprise images) in the
  environment variables `BINTRAY_USERNAME` and `BINTRAY_APIKEY`, or manually
  log in to the Kong docker repo.
* If you do not have Bintray credentials, make sure to have a docker image of
  Kong Enterprise, and set the image name in the environment variable `KONG_IMAGE`.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install Pongo:
```shell
PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-pongo.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s $(realpath kong-pongo/pongo.sh) ~/.local/bin/pongo
```

_Notes_: 
* you need `~/.local/bin` on your `$PATH`
* for MacOS you need the [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html)
  to be installed. This is easiest via the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) by doing:
  ```
  brew install coreutils
  ```

## Do a test run

Get a shell into your plugin repository, and run `pongo`, for example:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-plugin.git
cd kong-plugin

# auto pull and build the test images
pongo run ./spec

# Run against a specific version of Kong (log into bintray first!) and pass
# a number of Busted options
KONG_VERSION=0.36-1 pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec

# Run against the latest patch version of a Kong release using '.x'
KONG_VERSION=1.2.x pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec

# Run against a local image of Kong
KONG_IMAGE=kong-ee pongo run ./spec
```

The above command (`pongo run`) will automatically build the test image and
start the test environment. When done, the test environment can be torn down by:

```shell
pongo down
```

## Test dependencies

Pongo can use a set of test dependencies that can be used to test against. Each
can be enabled/disabled by respectively specifying `--[dependency_name]` or
`--no-[dependency-name]` as options for the `pongo run` and `pongo build`
commands. The alternate way of specifying the dependencies is
by adding them to the `.pongorc` file (see below).

The available dependencies are:

* **Postgres** Kong datastore (started by default)
  - Disable it with `--no-postgres`
  - The Postgres version is controlled by the `POSTGRES` environment variable

* **Cassandra** Kong datastore (started by default)
  - Disable it with `--no-cassandra`
  - The Cassandra version is controlled by the `CASSANDRA` environment variable

* **Redis** key-value store
  - Enable it with `--redis`
  - The Redis version is controlled by the `REDIS` environment variable
  - From within the environment the Redis instance is available at `redis:6379`,
    but from the test specs it should be accessed by using the `helpers.redis_host`
    field, and port `6379`, to keep it portable to other test environments. Example:
    ```shell
    local helpers = require "spec.helpers"
    local redis_host = helpers.redis_host
    local redis_port = 6379
    ```

* **Squid** (forward-proxy)
  - Enable it with `--squid`
  - The Squid version is controlled by the `SQUID` environment variable
  - From within the environment the Squid instance is available at `squid:3128`. 
    Essentially it would be configured as these standard environment variables:

    - `http_proxy=http://squid:3128/`
    - `https_proxy=http://squid:3128/`

    The configuration comes with basic-auth configuration, and a single user:

    - username: `kong`
    - password: `king`

    All access is to be authenticated by the proxy, except for the domain `.mockbin.org`,
    which is white-listed.

    Some test instructions to play with the proxy:
    ```shell
    # clean environment, start with squid and create a shell
    pongo down
    pongo up --squid --no-postgres --no-cassandra
    pongo shell

    # connect to httpbin (http), while authenticating
    http --proxy=http:http://kong:king@squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://kong:king@squid:3128 http://httpbin.org/anything

    # https also works
    http --proxy=http:http://kong:king@squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://kong:king@squid:3128 https://httpbin.org/anything

    # connect unauthenticated to the whitelisted mockbin.org (http)
    http --proxy=http:http://squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://squid:3128 http://mockbin.org/request

    # and here https also works
    http --proxy=http:http://squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://squid:3128 https://mockbin.org/request
    ```

### Dependency defaults; `.pongorc`

The defaults do not make sense for every type of plugin and some dependencies
(Cassandra for example) can slow down the tests. So to override the defaults on
a per project/plugin basis, a `.pongorc` file can be added to the project.

The format of the file is very simple; each line contains 1 commandline option, eg.
a `.pongorc` file for a plugin that only needs Postgres and Redis:

  ```shell
  --no-cassandra
  --redis
  ```


## Debugging

When running the tests, the Kong prefix (or working directory) will be set to
`./servroot`.

To track the error log (where any `print` or `ngx.log` statements will go) you
can use the tail command

```shell
pongo tail
```

The above would be identical to:

```shell
tail -F ./servroot/logs/error.log
```

## Test initialization

By default when the test container is started, it will look for a `.rockspec`
file, if it finds one, then it will install that rockspec file with the
`--deps-only` flag. Meaning it will not install that rock itself, but if it
depends on any external libraries, those rocks will be installed.

For example; the Kong plugin `session` relies on the `lua-resty-session` rock.
So by default it will install that dependency before starting the tests.

An alternate way is to provide a `.pongo-setup.sh` file. If that file is present
then that file will be executed (using `source`), instead of the default behaviour.

For example, the following `.pongo-setup.sh` file will install a specific
development branch of `lua-resty-session` instead of the one specified in
the rockspec:

```shell
# remove any existing version if installed
luarocks remove lua-resty-session --force

git clone https://github.com/Tieske/lua-resty-session
cd lua-resty-session

# now checkout and install the development branch
git checkout redis-ssl
luarocks make

cd ..
rm -rf lua-resty-session
```

## Releasing (new Kong versions)

When new Kong versions are released, the test artifacts contained within this
Pongo repository must be updated.

To do so there are some pre-requisites;

- have [hub](https://hub.github.com/) installed and configured
- on OSX have [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) installed
- have access to the `kong-pongo` and `kong-ee` repositories on Github

Update the version as follows:

```shell
# The code-base is either "EE" (Enterprise) or "CE" (Opensource)

KONG_CODE_BASE="EE" ADD_KONG_VERSION="1.2.3" \
  && git clone http://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo.git \
  && kong-pongo/assets/add_version.sh $KONG_CODE_BASE $ADD_KONG_VERSION
```

The result should be a new PR on Pongo repo.
