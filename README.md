Usage: pongo action [options...] [--] [action options...]

Options:
  --no-cassandra     do not start cassandra db
  --no-postgres      do not start postgres db
  --redis            do start redis db

Actions:
  up            start required dependency containers for testing

  build         build the Kong test image

  run           run spec files, accepts Busted options and spec files/folders
                as arguments, see: 'pongo run -- --help'

  shell         get a shell directly on a kong container

  down          remove all dependency containers

  clean         removes the dependency containers and deletes all test images

Environment variables:
  KONG_VERSION  the specific Kong version to use when building the test image

  KONG_IMAGE    the base Kong Docker image to use when building the test image

  KONG_LICENSE_DATA
                set this variable with the Kong Enterprise license data

  POSTGRES      the version of the Postgres dependency to use (default 9.5)
  CASSANDRA     the version of the Cassandra dependency to use (default 3.9)
  REDIS         the version of the Redis dependency to use (default 5.0.4)

Example usage:
  pongo run
  KONG_VERSION=0.36-1 pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec/02-access_spec.lua
  POSTGRES=9.4 KONG_IMAGE=kong-ee pongo run
  pongo down
```

# pongo

Pongo provides a simple way of testing Kong plugins

## Requirements

Set up the following when testing against Kong Enterprise:

* Have the Kong Enterprise license key, and set it in `KONG_LICENSE_DATA`.
* Have a docker image of Kong Enterprise, and set the image name in the
  environment variable `KONG_IMAGE`, or alternatively log in to Bintray before
  running Pongo.

## Installation

> Note you need `~/.local/bin` on your `$PATH`.

* clone the repo and install Pongo:
    ```shell
    PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
    git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-pongo.git
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    ln -s $(realpath kong-pongo/pongo.sh) ~/.local/bin/pongo
    ```

## Do a test run

Get a shell into your plugin repository, and run `pongo`, for example:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-plugin.git
cd kong-plugin

# auto pull and build the test images
pongo run ./spec

# Run against a specific version of Kong (log into bintray first!) and pass
# a number of Busted options
KONG_VERSION=0.36-1 pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec

# Run against a local image of Kong
KONG_IMAGE=kong-ee pongo run ./spec
```

The above command (`pongo run`) will automatically build the test image and
start the test environment. When done, the test environment can be torn down by:

```shell
pongo down
```

## Debugging

When running the tests, the Kong prefix (or working directory) will be set to
`./servroot`.

So to track what is happening you can use a `tail` on `./servroot/logs/error.log`
like this:

```shell
tail -F ./servroot/logs/error.log
```

## How it works

The repo has 3 main components;

1. `pongo.sh`: This is the actual test script. It can be run from a
   plugin repo. It can build the test image and set up the datastores
   (postgres & cassandra). And then run the tests found in the repo.
   As a user, this is the only script you need.
2. docker-compose file: this has the dependencies (postgres and cassandra).
   there is no need to use docker-compose, it can be used transparently from
   Pongo.
3. `update_versions.sh`: This is a script that extracts the development files
   from the Kong source repos and stores them in this repo. This script
   should only be updated (version list at the top), and run, after a new
   version of Kong has been released. There is no need to use this script
   as a user of Pongo.
