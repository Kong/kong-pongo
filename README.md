## Requirements

Set up the following when testing against Kong Enterprise:

* Set the Bintray credentials (for pulling Kong Enterprise images) in the
  environment variables `BINTRAY_USERNAME` and `BINTRAY_APIKEY`, or manually
  log in to the Kong docker repo.
* Have the Kong Enterprise license key, and set it in `KONG_LICENSE_DATA`,
  alternatively set variable `BINTRAY_REPO` to your repository name (in addition
  to `BINTRAY_USERNAME` and `BINTRAY_APIKEY`) to allow Pongo to download the
  license file automatically.
* If you do not have Bintray credentials, make sure to have a docker image of
  Kong Enterprise, and set the image name in the environment variable `KONG_IMAGE`.

See [Setting up CI](#setting-up-ci) for some Bintray environment variable examples.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install Pongo:
```shell
PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-pongo.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s $(realpath kong-pongo/pongo.sh) ~/.local/bin/pongo
```

_Notes_: 
* you need `~/.local/bin` on your `$PATH`
* for MacOS you need the [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html)
  to be installed. This is easiest via the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) by doing:
  ```
  brew install coreutils
  ```

## Do a test run

Get a shell into your plugin repository, and run `pongo`, for example:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Kong/kong-plugin.git
cd kong-plugin

# auto pull and build the test images
pongo run ./spec

# Run against a specific version of Kong (log into bintray first!) and pass
# a number of Busted options
KONG_VERSION=0.36-1 pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec

# Run against the latest patch version of a Kong release using '.x'
KONG_VERSION=1.2.x pongo run -v -o gtest ./spec

# Run against a local image of Kong
KONG_IMAGE=kong-ee pongo run ./spec
```

The above command (`pongo run`) will automatically build the test image and
start the test environment. When done, the test environment can be torn down by:

```shell
pongo down
```

## Test dependencies

Pongo can use a set of test dependencies that can be used to test against. Each
can be enabled/disabled by respectively specifying `--[dependency_name]` or
`--no-[dependency-name]` as options for the `pongo up` and `pongo run`
commands. The alternate way of specifying the dependencies is
by adding them to the `.pongorc` file (see below).

The available dependencies are:

* **Postgres** Kong datastore (started by default)
  - Disable it with `--no-postgres`
  - The Postgres version is controlled by the `POSTGRES` environment variable

* **Cassandra** Kong datastore (started by default)
  - Disable it with `--no-cassandra`
  - The Cassandra version is controlled by the `CASSANDRA` environment variable

* **Redis** key-value store
  - Enable it with `--redis`
  - The Redis version is controlled by the `REDIS` environment variable
  - From within the environment the Redis instance is available at `redis:6379`,
    but from the test specs it should be accessed by using the `helpers.redis_host`
    field, and port `6379`, to keep it portable to other test environments. Example:
    ```shell
    local helpers = require "spec.helpers"
    local redis_host = helpers.redis_host
    local redis_port = 6379
    ```

* **Squid** (forward-proxy)
  - Enable it with `--squid`
  - The Squid version is controlled by the `SQUID` environment variable
  - From within the environment the Squid instance is available at `squid:3128`. 
    Essentially it would be configured as these standard environment variables:

    - `http_proxy=http://squid:3128/`
    - `https_proxy=http://squid:3128/`

    The configuration comes with basic-auth configuration, and a single user:

    - username: `kong`
    - password: `king`

    All access is to be authenticated by the proxy, except for the domain `.mockbin.org`,
    which is white-listed.

    Some test instructions to play with the proxy:
    ```shell
    # clean environment, start with squid and create a shell
    pongo down
    pongo up --squid --no-postgres --no-cassandra
    pongo shell

    # connect to httpbin (http), while authenticating
    http --proxy=http:http://kong:king@squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://kong:king@squid:3128 http://httpbin.org/anything

    # https also works
    http --proxy=http:http://kong:king@squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://kong:king@squid:3128 https://httpbin.org/anything

    # connect unauthenticated to the whitelisted mockbin.org (http)
    http --proxy=http:http://squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://squid:3128 http://mockbin.org/request

    # and here https also works
    http --proxy=http:http://squid:3128 --proxy=https:http://squid:3128 https://mockbin.org/request
    ```

### Dependency defaults

The defaults do not make sense for every type of plugin and some dependencies
(Cassandra for example) can slow down the tests. So to override the defaults on
a per project/plugin basis, a `.pongorc` file can be added to the project.

The format of the file is very simple; each line contains 1 commandline option, eg.
a `.pongorc` file for a plugin that only needs Postgres and Redis:

  ```shell
  --no-cassandra
  --redis
  ```

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Debugging

When running the tests, the Kong prefix (or working directory) will be set to
`./servroot`.

To track the error log (where any `print` or `ngx.log` statements will go) you
can use the tail command

```shell
pongo tail
```

The above would be identical to:

```shell
tail -F ./servroot/logs/error.log
```

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Test initialization

By default when the test container is started, it will look for a `.rockspec`
file, if it finds one, then it will install that rockspec file with the
`--deps-only` flag. Meaning it will not install that rock itself, but if it
depends on any external libraries, those rocks will be installed.

For example; the Kong plugin `session` relies on the `lua-resty-session` rock.
So by default it will install that dependency before starting the tests.

An alternate way is to provide a `.pongo-setup.sh` file. If that file is present
then that file will be executed (using `source`), instead of the default behaviour.

For example, the following `.pongo-setup.sh` file will install a specific
development branch of `lua-resty-session` instead of the one specified in
the rockspec:

```shell
# remove any existing version if installed
luarocks remove lua-resty-session --force

git clone https://github.com/Tieske/lua-resty-session
cd lua-resty-session

# now checkout and install the development branch
git checkout redis-ssl
luarocks make

cd ..
rm -rf lua-resty-session
```

## Setting up CI

Pongo is easily added to a CI setup. The examples below will asume Travis-CI, but
can be easily converted to other engines.

Here's a base setup for an open-source plugin that will test against 2 Kong versions:
```yaml
# .travis.yml

dist: bionic

jobs:
  include:
  - name: Kong CE 2.0.x
    env: KONG_VERSION=2.0.x
  - name: Kong CE 1.5.x
    env: KONG_VERSION=1.5.x

install:
- git clone --single-branch https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo ../kong-pongo
- "../kong-pongo/pongo.sh up"
- "../kong-pongo/pongo.sh build"

script:
- "../kong-pongo/pongo.sh lint"
- "../kong-pongo/pongo.sh run"
```

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Setting up CI with Kong Enterprise

To test against an Enterprise version of Kong the same base setup can be used, but
some secrets need to be added. With the secrets in place Pongo will be able to
download the proper Kong Enterprise images and the required license keys.

The environment variables needed are:
- `BINTRAY_USERNAME=<your Bintray username>`
- `BINTRAY_APIKEY=<your Bintray API key>`
- `BINTRAY_REPO=<your Kong Bintray repo name>`

Typically they would look something like this:
- `BINTRAY_USERNAME=thijs-schreijer@kong`
- `BINTRAY_APIKEY=Xa6htQZoS/4Ko8VSj7hFGm2LnQDng6c5xIBJ`
- `BINTRAY_REPO=pongo`

To test the values try the following command, if succesful it will display
your license key:
```
$ curl -L -u"$BINTRAY_USERNAME:$BINTRAY_APIKEY" "https://kong.bintray.com/$BINTRAY_REPO/license.json"
```

Once the test command is succesful you can add the secrets to the Travis-CI
configuration. To add those secrets install the
[Travis command line utility](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb), and
follow these steps:
- Copy the `.travis.yml` file above into your plugin repo
- Enter the main directory of your plugins repo
- Add the encrypted values by doing:

  - `travis encrypt --pro BINTRAY_USERNAME=<your_user_name_here> --add`
  - `travis encrypt --pro BINTRAY_APIKEY=<your_api_key_here> --add`
  - `travis encrypt --pro BINTRAY_REPO=<your_Bintray_repo_name_here> --add`

After completing the steps above, the `.travis.yml` file should now be updated
and have this additional section:

```yaml
env:
  global:
  - secure: Xa6htQZoS/4K...and some more gibberish
  - secure: o8VSj7hFGm2L...and some more gibberish
  - secure: nQDng6c5xIBJ...and some more gibberish
```

Now you can update the `jobs` section and add Kong Enterprise version numbers.

## Releasing (new Kong versions)

When new Kong versions are released, the test artifacts contained within this
Pongo repository must be updated.

To do so there are some pre-requisites;

- have [hub](https://hub.github.com/) installed and configured
- on OSX have [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) installed
- have access to the `kong-pongo` (push) and `kong-ee` (read/clone) repositories on Github

Update the version as follows:

```shell
# The code-base is either "EE" (Enterprise) or "CE" (Opensource)

KONG_CODE_BASE="EE" ADD_KONG_VERSION="1.2.3" \
  && git clone http://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo.git \
  && kong-pongo/assets/add_version.sh $KONG_CODE_BASE $ADD_KONG_VERSION
```

The result should be a new PR on the Pongo repo.
