LuaRocks is the package manager for Lua modules and is also used by (and
shipped with) Kong. To package a plugin for distribution the package needs to
be specifed using a 'rockspec' file (see LuaRocks documentation or other
Kong-plugins for details).

On any Kong system 'luarocks install <rockname.rock>' should install the plugin.
