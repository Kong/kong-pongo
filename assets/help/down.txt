Usage: pongo down [--all]

This will stop the current environment and remove all dependency containers (eg.
postgres, etc.). This also means that any state in those containers is lost.

If the option '--all' is specified then all environments will be torn down.

Example usage:
  pongo down
  pongo down --all
