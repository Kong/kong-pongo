Usage: pongo build [--force]

This will build a Kong test image if it does not already exist. To force a
rebuild of an image use the '--force' flag.

The base image used to build the test image can be specified using the
following 2 environment variables:

  KONG_VERSION  the specific Kong version to use when building the test image
                (note that the patch-version can be 'x' to use latest).
                2 special case; 'nightly' and 'nightly-ee' can be specified to
                use the nightly builds.

  KONG_IMAGE    the base Kong Docker image to use when building the test image

If neither is specified it will default to the latest Kong open source version.


Example usage:
  KONG_VERSION=1.3.x pongo build --force
  KONG_VERSION=nightly-ee pongo build
  KONG_IMAGE=custom-kong-ee pongo build
