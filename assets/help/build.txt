Usage: pongo build [--force]

This will build a Kong test image if it does not already exist. To force a
rebuild of an image use the '--force' flag, or set PONGO_FORCE_BUILD to anything
else than 'false'.

The build can be customized using the following environment variables:

  KONG_VERSION  the specific Kong version to use when building the test image
                (note that the patch-version can be 'x' to use latest).
                Special cases;
                  - 'stable' and 'stable-ee' can be specified to use the
                    latest stable/released Kong versions.
                  - 'dev' and 'dev-ee' can be specified to use the
                    latest development builds.

  KONG_IMAGE    the base Kong Docker image to use when building the test image

  PONGO_DOCKER_FILE  The dockerfile used to build the test image of Kong. The
                     default is "[pongo]/assets/Dockerfile'. Use that file as a
                     base for any customizations.

  PONGO_FORCE_BUILD  If set to anything else than 'false' it will force a
                     rebuild. This is equivalent to the '--force' flag, but will
                     also work with 'pongo run'.

  PONGO_INSECURE  If set to anything else than 'false' it will configure curl
                  and git to turn of tls verification when downloading files
                  during the build. This can be used with issues around
                  certificate validation behind proxies. Make sure you
                  understand the security consequences when using this option!

If neither KONG_VERSION nor KONG_IMAGE is specified it will default to the
latest Kong open source version.


Example usage:
  KONG_VERSION=1.3.x pongo build --force
  KONG_VERSION=dev-ee pongo build
  KONG_IMAGE=custom-kong-ee pongo build
