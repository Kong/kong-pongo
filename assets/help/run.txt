Usage: pongo run [options...] [--] [busted options...]

This will start a test run. If an environment is running it will use that, if
not, it will automatically start the environment (and automatically build the
Kong test images in the process).

Options (see 'pongo up' for details):
  --no-cassandra     do not start cassandra db
  --no-postgres      do not start postgres db
  --grpcbin          do start grpcbin
  etc.

Busted options:
  The defaults in '.busted' (see 'pongo init' on how to generate it) will be
  used, but can be overridden by the options on the command line. The '--'
  commandline separator is not required but might prevent collissions for
  similar named 'busted' and 'pongo' options.
  Use 'pongo run -- --help' to get the busted commandline help.

  NOTE: the filepaths specified will automatically be converted to the same
  path, but mounted inside the container, eg:

     pongo run -- ./spec/01-schema_spec.lua

  would run inside the container as:

     busted /kong-plugin/spec/01-schema_spec.lua

  So the paths in the test output need to be converted back to the original
  files.
  The default is set to './spec' and cannot be overridden using the '.busted'
  configuration file.

Environment variables:
  See variables at 'pongo up' for auto starting the environment (not used when
  an environment is already running)

  See variables at 'pongo build' for building the test-image (the Kong version
  to test against)


Example usage:
  pongo run
  KONG_VERSION=nightly pongo run
  KONG_VERSION=1.3.x pongo run -v -o TAP ./spec/02-access_spec.lua
  POSTGRES=10 KONG_IMAGE=kong-ee pongo run
