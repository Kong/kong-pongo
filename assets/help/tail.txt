Usage: pongo tail [logfile]

Will start a tail on the specified file. The default file is
'./servroot/logs/error.log'. If the file does not exist, it will wait for 5
minutes for the file to appear.

When doing a test run this command can be used to tail the log file to check
for any errors or debug information in a second terminal.


Example usage:
  pongo tail
  pongo tail ./servroot/logs/access.log
