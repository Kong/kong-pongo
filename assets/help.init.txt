Usage: pongo init

Initializes the current plugin directory with some default configuration files
if not already there. It is not required to run 'pongo init' on a plugin to be
able to use Pongo.

When run it will validate that the directory is a plugin, when either;
 - there is a sub-directory './kong/plugins/<xyz>', or
 - the current directory is named 'kong-plugin-<xyz>'

The files added (if not there):
 - '.busted' with default settings for the test Busted framework
 - '.luacheckrc' with sanity checks for the Lua source code using the 'luacheck'
   linter through 'pongo lint'.
 - '.editorconfig' containing default editor settings
 - '.gitignore'

If the '.gitignore' file already exists it will add the following entries:
 - 'servroot' which is the working directory/prefix when running tests
 - '*.rock' the binary rock format created by LuaRocks and/or 'pongo pack'


Example usage:
  mkdir kong-plugin-awesome
  cd kong-plugin-awesome
  pongo init
