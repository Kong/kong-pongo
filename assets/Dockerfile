# httpie and jq are genric utilities usable from the shell action.
# LuaRocks needs (un)zip to (un)pack rocks, and dev essentials to build.
# Setup the developemnt dependencies using the make target
# and make the entrypoint executable
#
# Note: 'openssl-dev' (and m4, bsd-headers) is added to build the 'cqueue' rock.
# It provides the headers in the system location for 'make dependencies' to succeed.
# The proper thing to do would be the included ones by specifying them like so:
#   CRYPTO_DIR=/usr/local/kong \
#   OPENSSL_DIR=/usr/local/kong \
#   make dependencies
# But that means hardcoding and that doesn't play well with the nature of Pongo
# that should be independent of Kong versions.
