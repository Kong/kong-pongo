## 2.0.0 released 20-Oct-2022

#### Upgrading

* Upgrade Pongo

  * run `pongo clean` using the `1.x` version of Pongo, to cleanup old artifacts
    and images

  * `cd` into the folder where Pongo resides and do a `git pull`, followed by
    `git checkout 2.0.0`

* Upgrade Plugin repositories

  * on your plugin repositories run `pongo init` to update any settings (git-ignoring
    bash history mostly)

  * if your test matrix for Kong versions to test against include Kong CE versions prior
    to `2.0` or Kong EE versions prior to `3.0` then update the CI to use the proper
    version of Pongo that supports those versions. So pick a Pongo version depending
    on the Kong version being tested.

  * if your test matrix for Kong versions to test against includes `nightly`
    and/or `nightly-ee` then those should respectively be updated to `dev` and
    `dev-ee`.

  * If you need Cassandra when testing, then ensure in the plugin repositories that
    the `.pongo/pongorc` file contains: `--cassandra`, since it is no longer started
    by default.

  * Update test initialization scripts `.pongo/pongo-setup.sh`. They will now be
    sourced in `bash` instead of in `sh`.

#### Changes

* [BREAKING] the Kong base image is now `Ubuntu` (previously `Alpine`). The default
  shell now is `/bin/bash` (was `/bin/sh`)

* [BREAKING] Support for Kong Enterprise versions before `3.0` is dropped (this is
  because for Enterprise there were never Ubuntu images published in the 2.x range)

* [BREAKING] Support for Kong opensource versions before `2.0` is dropped

* [BREAKING] Cassandra is no longer started by default.

* [BREAKING] The version tags to test against Kong development branches; `nightly`
  and `nightly-ee` have been renamed to `dev` and `dev-ee` (because they are not
  nightlies but the latest commit to the master branch)

* Feat: new tags have been defined to test against the latest stable/released
  versions of Kong and Kong Enterprise; `stable` and `stable-ee`

* Fix: if the license cannot be downloaded the license variable would contain the
  404 html response, which would cause unrelated problems. The variable is now
  cleared upon failure.

## 1.3.0 released 19-Sep-2022

* Feat: Kong Enterprise 3.0.0.0

* Feat: Kong OSS 3.0.0

* Fix: change the `kong` user to the ID of the `/kong-plugin` folder owner, to
  prevent permission issues when starting Kong (access to the `servroot` working
  directory which is located in the mounted folder)
  [#321](https://github.com/Kong/kong-pongo/pull/321)

* Fix: location of the unofficial Kong image (used between releasing and
  Docker hub availability).
